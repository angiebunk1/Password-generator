# Password Generator 

## Description

An application for generating a random password of any length between 8 and 128 characters and any combination of upper or lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.  

## Contribution

I was provided with the html and stylesheets, as well as the beginnings of a script file.  The js included an event listener for clicking a button that would trigger the functions I created.  The functions I added asked for password length, as well as prompted confirmation for each type of character to include.  I also added a function for converting the information received from the user into a unique and random password.  The script already included a function for displaying the password on the page once it had been generated.
